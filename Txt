Project Overview:

Daikibo collected machine telemetry data from four factories for one month. Each factory had nine types of machines reporting health every ten minutes.

Factories:

Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)

Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)

Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)

Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)

The questions we wanted to answer:

Which factory had the most machine downtime?

Which machines broke the most in that factory?


Tools Used:

Tableau Desktop (Public Edition)

JSON data file

Excel for equality classification

Dashboard creation and filtering

Task 1: Machine Telemetry Analysis

Imported the JSON data into Tableau

Created a calculated field called Unhealthy, assigning 10 minutes for each unhealthy status


Built two bar charts:

Down Time per Factory

Down Time per Device Type

Made a dashboard where selecting a factory shows downtime by device type

Found that Daikibo Factory Seiko had the highest downtime

Laser welding machines caused the most downtime in that factory

Task 2: Employee Equality Analysis

Worked with employee compensation data in Excel

Added a new column called Equality Class


Classified scores as:

Fair (-10 to +10)

Unfair (<-10 or >10)

Highly Discriminative (<-20 or >20)

This helped identify areas where compensation might be unfair or highly discriminatory.


What I Learned

How to work with raw JSON data in Tableau

How to create calculated fields and measure downtime

How to build interactive dashboards

How to classify and analyze data to show trends or risks

How data can be used to answer practical business questions
